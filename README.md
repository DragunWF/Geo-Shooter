# Geo-Shooter

## Description

A point and click shooter game made in 2 days with the Unity Engine and C#.

Play as a minion who can shoot in either the red faction or the blue faction. Survive as long you can and shoot down as many enemy minions you can handle. Defeating enemies gives you experience points which can level you up and increase your damage as well as your fire rate.

You can pick a side at the beginning of whether you can choose to join the blue faction or the red faction. The blue faction gives you double experience points for each kill while joining the red faction starts you up at a higher level.

Difficulty scales over time. Enemies get stronger and faster the more time passes. Enemy spawn rates also goes faster the longer you stand your ground. You get stronger over time as well by leveling up. Each time you level up, your health increases by 1.
